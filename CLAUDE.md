# Repository conventions

This repo is the source of **stouras.com** (Konstantinos Stouras' homepage),
served as a static site via GitHub Pages from the `master` branch. There is no
build step — HTML/CSS/JS are committed and served as-is.

## Fun Projects landing page — keep it in sync

`/fun/` (`fun/index.html`) is the landing page that lists every app under
`stouras.com/fun/`. Each app is one `<li class="app">` card.

**Whenever a new app is added under `fun/<name>/`, you MUST also add a matching
card to `fun/index.html`** (and remove/rename the card if an app is removed or
renamed). Do this in the same change that introduces the app, so the landing
page never drifts out of sync with what actually ships.

For a new card:
- Put the newest app first in the `<ul class="apps">` list.
- Link the title to `/fun/<name>/`.
- Add a one–two sentence `<p>` description matching the app.
- Optional `<span class="tag">New</span>` (green) for a new app, or
  `<span class="tag gr">…</span>` (blue) to flag a Greek-language app.
- If it broadens the site's scope, also refresh the page's `<meta name="description">`
  and `<meta name="keywords">` to mention it.

The homepage's "Fun Projects" section (in the root site) may also link apps —
keep that in mind if a change there is warranted.

## Current /fun/ apps
