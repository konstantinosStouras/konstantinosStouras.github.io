  <h2>Individual Ideation Phase <span class="emoji">ðŸ‘¤</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to the <strong>Individual Phase</strong> of the challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this part, you'll work <strong>completely on your own</strong> to generate ideas for new products in the
    <strong>health and wellness market</strong>. Please <strong>do not communicate or collaborate</strong> with others during this phase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Focus on creating as many ideas as you can â€” big or small, practical or experimental. Each idea should aim to
    offer value, improvement, or innovation in health and wellness.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll have a limited amount of time to complete this phase, so work efficiently and record your ideas clearly.
    When the timer ends, you'll move on to the next stage.
  </p>
