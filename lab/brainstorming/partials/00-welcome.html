  <p>You are about to take part in an ideation challenge focused on generating and evaluating new product concepts in the health and wellness market.</p>
  <p>The goal of this study is to understand how people generate ideas, make evaluations, and reach decisions when developing new products that could succeed in existing or emerging markets. We are interested in the different ways individuals and groups think, communicate, and decide which ideas are most promising from a consumer and market perspective.</p>
