    Welcome to the <strong>Group Phase</strong> of the challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this part, you'll work <strong>together with your group</strong> to share, discuss, and refine ideas for new products in the
    <strong>health and wellness market</strong>. Each group member brings unique perspectives — use discussion and collaboration to strengthen your concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can build upon ideas from your teammates, combine different suggestions, or develop entirely new ones as a team.
    Focus on creating ideas that are clear, feasible, and innovative.
