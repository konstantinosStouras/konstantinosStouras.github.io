          Welcome to the <strong>Group Phase</strong> of the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this part, you’ll work <strong>together with your group</strong> to share, discuss, and refine ideas for new products in the
          <strong>health and wellness market</strong>. Each group member brings unique perspectives — use discussion and collaboration to strengthen your concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can build upon ideas from your teammates, combine different suggestions, or develop entirely new ones as a team.
          Focus on creating ideas that are clear, feasible, and innovative.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll have a limited amount of time to complete this phase, so communicate efficiently and make sure every voice is heard.
        </p>
